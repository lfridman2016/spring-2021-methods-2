## The dark side of Discord for teens

https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/22/tech/discord-teens/index.html

I chose this article because as a parent of a soon-to-be teenager I am interested in ways to protect young people from harm caused by online social platforms. I see my students using Discord often and I myself have considered it for classroom purposes so that sparked my curiosity. This article highlights concerns about the social media platform Discord and teen use. It depicts several cases of teenagers being exposed to sexually explicit material, stalking by adult predators, privacy violations, and participation in harmful groups such as those encouraging self-harm. The platform is not as well known as Facebook or Instagram and therefore is not commonly blocked by schools, and parents are not familiar with its features. Private chat rooms are a particular area of concern. Discord claims that it takes actions both from a technical perspective and from the customer service side to protect teenagers, however, many parents report a frustrating and unhelpful experience in getting Discord to take action.

During a brief class discussion I would pose the following questions:
- How much if any responsibility do you think discord has for protecting its teen users?
- What steps would you tell a parent to take if they are concerned about their teenâ€™s use of discord?
