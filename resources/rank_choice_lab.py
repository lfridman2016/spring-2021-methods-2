# in text.
# Write a function that will take a string of csv data and
# return a list of lists.
# Each sublist should represent a single line, with the
# values separated by commas.

# For example, the first two elements in this list given
# the avengers data should be:
#    [['Captain America', 'Falcon', 'Black Widow', 'Iron Man', 'Thor'],
#     ['Black Widow', 'Thor', 'Falcon', 'Captain America', 'Iron Man'],

print(('=' * 10) + "Problem 1" + ('=' * 10))

# In order to do ranked choice voting, we

# the specific rank in a given ballot.

# This function should take a list of lists, like
# what make_lists returns as input.

# It should create and return a dictionary where the
# keys are the names on the ballots, and the values
# are the number of people that voted for that name
# in the given rank.

# Assume that rank 0 means top choice, rank 1 means second, etc

# We can make pie charts to visualize this.

# This function should take a dictionary like the one returned
# in problem 1, and generate a pie chart where each wedge

# For ranked choice voting, it is also important to find
# the candidate with the fewest votes.

# This function should take a dictionary like one that

# with keys 'name', and 'pct', containing the name and
# perect vote of the bottom candidate.

# remove all votes for the last place candidate.

# This function should create a new list that is
# almost identical to the one generated by make_lists
# (problem 0), except it will not contain any values
# equal to the option parameter.

# For example, if Iron Man were given as option, then
# this function would create a new ballot list of
# lists, without any votes for Iron Man, but leaving
# everything else, and not changing the order.

# This function should:

    # display a bar graph of them: include the number of removed candidates in the title
    # display a pie chart of them: include the number of removed candidates in the title
    # calculate the percentages
    # find the top choice
    # find the bottom choice
    # print out the bottom choice
    # remove the bottom choice
    # repeat all these steps until the top choice has over 50% of the vote
    # At the end, return the top choice winner
