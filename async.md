# Asynchronous Activities

### Session 6: 3/21
  * Work with your collaborative planning teams.
  * Come up with the topic of your lesson (each person).
  * You don't need to have the discussions on slack, but each person should update the thread started last week with their lesson topic once you've figured it out.

### Session 5: 3/14
  * Over this course of this week 3/14 - 3/21, talk with your groups and come up with the common thread for your lessons. As a reminder, the lessons do not need to be in sequence (and probably shouldnâ€™t), but it should be clear after seeing the lessons what the common thread is.

### Session 4: 3/07
In the \#meth2_async channel:
  * https://grading4learning.github.io/workbook/practice/cases.html

### Session 3: 2/28

    - Scope-wise, consider a single in-class or homework level of assignment, nothing too big.
  * As a group, create scaffolding for the assignment.
  * Keep the discussion to your own groups thread.
  * Have one person put the final scaffold

### Session 2: 2/14
In the \#meth2_async channel:
